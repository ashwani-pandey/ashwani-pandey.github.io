It's always so awesome to learn something from David Malan. And this lecture of his was no different.

It is kind of funny and shocking that I am going to pass from college in a few months, and I literally don't have
much idea of building dynamic websites.

So, this course! ;)







-----
how to fix this - a website works at www.something.com but not at something.com 

2 pieces of solution
- first ensure that you have dns record for something.com, in association with one associated for www.st.com
- configure web server for st.com and www.st.com

records related to dns
	- ns
	- a
	- cname
	- mx record or mail exchange record
